/**
 * A DFA state represents a set of possible ATN configurations.
 * As Aho, Sethi, Ullman p. 117 says "The DFA uses its state
 * to keep track of all possible states the ATN can be in after
 * reading each input symbol.  That is to say, after reading
 * input a1a2..an, the DFA is in a state that represents the
 * subset T of the states of the ATN that are reachable from the
 * ATN's start state along some path labeled a1a2..an."
 * In conventional NFA&rarr;DFA conversion, therefore, the subset T
 * would be a bitset representing the set of states the
 * ATN could be in.  We need to track the alt predicted by each
 * state as well, however.  More importantly, we need to maintain
 * a stack of states, tracking the closure operations as they
 * jump from rule to rule, emulating rule invocations (method calls).
 * I have to add a stack to simulate the proper lookahead sequences for
 * the underlying LL grammar from which the ATN was derived.
 *
 * I use a set of ATNConfig objects not simple states.  An ATNConfig
 * is both a state (ala normal conversion) and a RuleContext describing
 * the chain of rules (if any) followed to arrive at that state.
 *
 * A DFA state may have multiple references to a particular state,
 * but with different ATN contexts (with same or different alts)
 * meaning that state was reached via a different set of rule invocations.
