/** An ATN transition between any two ATN states.  Subclasses define
 *  atom, set, epsilon, action, predicate, rule transitions.
 *
 *  This is a one way link.  It emanates from a state (usually via a list of
 *  transitions) and has a target state.
 *
 *  Since we never have to change the ATN transitions once we construct it,
 *  we can fix these transitions as specific classes. The DFA transitions
 *  on the other hand need to update the labels as it adds transitions to
 *  the states. We'll use the term Edge for the DFA to distinguish them from
 *  ATN transitions.
